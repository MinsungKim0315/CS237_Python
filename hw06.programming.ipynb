    "## The Two-Armed Bandit\n",
    "\n",
    "This game, named from a nickname for slot machines (which have\n",
    "two levers to pull and steal your money!), is played by a single player who has two coins:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $A$ with a probability of heads $p_A$, and   \n",
    "> $B$ with a probability of head $p_B$,\n",
    "  \n",
    "The player does not know the probabilities $p_A$ and $p_B$ and the coins are otherwise identical. \n",
    "\n",
    "One round of the game is played as follows: the player chooses one of the coins\n",
    "and flips it. If the result is heads, the player wins 1 point; if tails the player \n",
    "loses 1 point (which can be thought of as a net profit of $-1$ points). The game is played for\n",
    "some large number of rounds $n$ (though this is not important, and you might as well think of the game as continuing infinitely).\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is one of strategy: how do you maximize the points won?\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance it may seem like you can do no better than us a random strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "> RS:  In each round, uniformly at random  choose either A or B, say by using a third, fair coin, choosing A if heads, and B if tails. \n",
    "\n",
    " However, a strategy of \"win stay, lose shift\" has been proposed to\n",
    "optimize one's chances of success.  This strategy is simple: \n",
    "\n",
    ">  WSLS:  In the first round, use coin A. After that, if you win, \n",
    ">  then flip the same coin again; if you lose, switch to the other coin. \n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy has an intuitive appeal, because you would think that over a large\n",
    "number of rounds, the coin with the higher probability would tend to be flipped\n",
    "more often, resulting in more profit. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, no one has (yet) come up with a rigorous proof that this strategy is\n",
    "better than the random strategy. Hence we must fall back on experiments. \n",
    "In this problem we will investigate these\n",
    "two strategies and see if indeed the \"win stay, lose shift\" strategy is better\n",
    "than the random strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, complete the general template below to implement the basic framework for the game, then try the following experiments. Code to print out the results has been included. \n",
    "\n",
    "(A)  Set pa = pb = 0.5.  In this case, both strategies should be equivalent. Run \n",
    "the game for $10^5$ rounds  and print out the results, they\n",
    "should be very close. \n",

    "(B)  Set pa = 0.6 and pb = 0.4 and run for $10^5$ rounds. You should\n",

    "(C)  Set pa = 0.75 and pb = 0.25 and run for $10^5$ rounds. You should see a dramatic improvement. \n",

    "Try this without the seed (commenting out the line `seed(0)`, in which case you will see the general trend of\n",
    "these experiments, and then include the seed before you submit.  The comments below\n",
